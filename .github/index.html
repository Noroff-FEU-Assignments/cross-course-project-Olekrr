      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      The most important advice to give a client is never to trust incoming
      data, and to always sanitize incoming data. For example, HTTP headers and
      cookies and user uploaded files. They should adopt a cybersecurity
      framework. Their web server should use HTTPS and HSTS to encrypt data sent
      between clients and servers. They should also keep up to date on the
      current OWASP list of most common vulnerabilities. In cases where valuable
      information such as credit cards and phone numbers must be stored, only
      the last few digits should be visible so that only the user can recognize
      it. Encourage the use of two factor authentication through physical
      hardware such as a phone. They should also perform regular security
      exercises such as scans, mock attacks, and bounty programs.
